<p>The king wants to  protect his daughter from miscomfortable.He orders <b>"Burns every spindle in the whole kingdom"</b>. &nbsp&nbsp "Time passes and his daugther from grows up to a beautifuk,modest,good-natured and a wise princess.
 &nbsp Everyone falls in love with her.<br> One day when she is fifteen years old and the king and queen are not at home,she goes for a walk in the castle.She goes into every room and bed-chamber.Finally she comes to an old tower.
She climbs up the norrow stairs and reaches the door. <br>There is a rusty key in the lock...She turns it and opens the door.<br>She sees a little room and an old woman with a spindle in his hand.She is spanning her flax.<br>
            <b> "Good day,old mother,"</b>says the king's daugther,<b>"What are you doing here?".</b> "I am spinning,"says the old women.<br>
"Thats interesting.Can I try it?"she says.She takes the spindle and wants to spin, too.&nbsp&nbsp  Once she touches the spindle,she pricks her finger with it. Suddenly she falls down on the bed and lays in a deep sleep.<br>Once she falls 
asleep all the people and the animals in the castle fall asleep,too.<br>The king,the queen,the cook,the maids,the horses in the stables,the dogs in the yard,the pigeons on the roof,the flies on the wall and so on....<br>They
all fall into a deep sleep.Time passes by an not leaf moves,but a hedge of thorns begin to grow around the castle and covers it all so nothing can be seen inside.&nbsp&nbsp<br> People in the kingdom tell the story of this beautiful princess
and it goes about the country.<br> From time to time other kings sons come and try to get through the thorny hedge and get into the castle.</p>
